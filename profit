Write a program to calculate profit earn in an intraday share trading with following charges on following charges on transaction
//The current maximum intraday brokerage offered is 0.03%for buying and 0.03% for selling 
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float buyPrice, sellPrice, quantity;
    float buyBrokerage, sellBrokerage;
    float totalBuyCost, totalSellValue;
    float profit;

    // Input buy and sell prices
    printf("Enter buy price per share: ");
    scanf("%f", &buyPrice);
    printf("Enter sell price per share: ");
    scanf("%f", &sellPrice);
    
    // Input quantity
    printf("Enter quantity of shares: ");
    scanf("%f", &quantity);

    // Calculate brokerage charges
    buyBrokerage = buyPrice * quantity * 0.0003;
    sellBrokerage = sellPrice * quantity * 0.0003;

    // Calculate total buy cost and total sell value
    totalBuyCost = (buyPrice * quantity) + buyBrokerage;
    totalSellValue = (sellPrice * quantity) - sellBrokerage;

    // Calculate profit
    profit = totalSellValue - totalBuyCost;

    // Output
